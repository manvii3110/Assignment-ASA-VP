# Airplane-Seating-Algorithm

The problem statement is to allocate seats in a flight based on the input and rules listed below.
  - Always seat passengers starting from the front row to back, starting from the left to the right
  - Fill aisle seats first followed by window seats followed by center seats (any order in center seats)
  
This is written using python3. To run the program run ```python assignment.py``` in the command prompt. This will return the desired output in the terminal. 

# Test Cases
-   number of passengers - 30
    size = 4
    2D array - [[3,2], [4,3], [2,3], [3,4]]

    OUTPUT:-

-   number of passengers - 50
    size = 4
    2D array - [[3,4], [4,5], [2,3], [3,4]]

    OUTPUT:-

-   number of passengers - 15
    size = 2
    2D array - [[3, 3], [2, 2]]

    OUTPUT:-
